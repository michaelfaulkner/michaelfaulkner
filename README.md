### Hi there 👋

I'm an [EPSRC research fellow](https://epsrc.ukri.org/about/people/michaelfaulkner/) at the [University of Bristol](https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/persons/michael-faulkner(76c7604a-6db1-4d4f-948e-db5a1f7afc2b).html).  Primarily, I’m a computational statistical physicist, which means that I use statistics and simulation algorithms to model many particles interacting with one another in a single system.  I specialise in molecular simulation in soft-matter physics, Markovian Monte Carlo algorithms in statistical physics and Bayesian computation, and the theory and simulation of two-dimensional electrolytes, magnets and superconductors.

## 👨‍🔧  Main contributions on Github 
- An original co-author of [super-aLby](https://github.com/michaelfaulkner/super-aLby) (a Python application for super-relativistic Monte Carlo simulation in soft-matter physics and Bayesian computation).
- An original co-author of [JeLLyFysh](https://github.com/jellyfysh/JeLLyFysh) (a hybrid Python-C application for event-chain Monte Carlo simulation in soft-matter physics).
- The sole author of [xy-type-models](https://github.com/michaelfaulkner/xy-type-models) (a hybrid Fortran-Python application for Metropolis and event-chain Monte Carlo simulation of two-dimensional XY models and the two-dimensional lattice-field electrolyte).

## 🔭  Current research
- I’m currently using [my model](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.91.155412) of ergodicity breaking in the two-dimensional electrolyte in order to explain [correlated resistance fluctuations](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.134503) at the superconducting transition in lanthanum strontium copper oxide.  This is made possible by the [emergent electrostatics in XY models](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-648X/aa523f) of thin-film and layered type-II superconductors (and many other thin-film and layered systems).  The project uses [xy-type-models](https://github.com/michaelfaulkner/xy-type-models) to simulate the model system.
- With collegues in computational statistics, I’m also writing a guide to statistical physics for the statistician.  This will be useful because there's a lot of overlap between the two fields, but cross-pollination of knowledge is slow due to poor understanding (within each discipline) of the goals and nomenclature of the other field.  This project uses [super-aLby](https://github.com/michaelfaulkner/super-aLby) and [xy-type-models](https://github.com/michaelfaulkner/xy-type-models) to simulate the models presented.

## 🌱  Future plans
- Emergent physical dynamics in Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithms.
- Application of ideas from Bayesian computation to fix some fundamental convergence issues in [JeLLyFysh](https://github.com/jellyfysh/JeLLyFysh).
- Further projects on emergent electrostatics in two-dimensional XY models.
